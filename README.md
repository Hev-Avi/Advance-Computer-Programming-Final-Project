# I. Project Overview 

Ecogrow : A tree-planting donation system dedicated to reforesting the planet. It connects individuals, oranization, and communities to support tree-planting initiatives, empowering donors to fundreforestation projects. Each donation contributes to greener, healthier future, one leaf at a time. This donation system program was built using Python, Tkinter, and MySQL.

# II. Python Concepts, Libraries, and Database application


## 1. Python Concepts

  - **Function**:
    
      - A function is a reusable block of code designed to carry out a specific task. It also helps organize code, making it easier to read, maintain, and manage.
        
  - **Object-Oriented-Program**:
    
      - OOP organizes code by structuring it around objects that combine data and behavior. It focuses on modeling real-world entities to make software design more intuitive and modular. Key elements of OOP, such as inheritance and polymorphism were used to enhance code reusability and flexibility.
        
  - **Error Handling**:

      - Was programed since it ensure the program can handle issues like errors without crashing, by providing warnings or notifying the user when there is incorrect input. It was uused to handle runtime errors using if try, and except.
          
## 2. Libraries

  - **Mysql**:
      - MySQL was used for storing and managing data which was used for donors, tree types, donation locations, and donation history. It is also used for the operation for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.
   
   - **Tkinter**:
       - Tkinter was used for creating the Graphical User Interface making it more presentable and easier to interact with the program. GUI offers widget, buttons, label, and tree views for the user interfaces.

## SDG ad Its Integration into the Project

   - **SDG 15: Life on Land**
     
       - SDG 15 is where it aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosysytem. This also focuses only to ensure the conservation of nature while promoting the sustainable management of forest, biodiversity, and land resources.
       - The program is a donation system centered around tree planting, allowing users to select the type of tree they wish to donate and choose the location for planting. Users can make donations by providing their details, selecting a tree, and specifying the donation amount, with all data recorded for future reference.

## IV. Instructions for Running the Program 

**STEPS:**

1. Download the `EcoGrow Files.zip`.

2. Extract the `Ecogrow Files.zip`
     - where it conatains the following:
         -*`Eco Grow Program`*
         - *`Ecogrow.py`*
         - *`Ecogrow.sql`*
         - *`README.md`*
         - *`EcoGrow_images(di pa sure)`*

3. Open XAMPP and start the Mysql service
     - link for Xampp: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
  
4. Open and copy the *`EcoGrow.sql`* file 
    - THE ENTIRE SCRIPT SHOULD BE COPIED PROPERLY TO WORK

5. Paste the script from *``EcoGrow.sql* to Command Prompt
   
7. Run the program:
     - Open the *`Eco Grow Program`* in the Visual Studio Code and run the program using *Ctrl + Alt + N*
     - Link for VScode: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

**"TAKE NOTE, WHEN RUNNING THE PROGRAM PYTHON IS REQUIRED"**
